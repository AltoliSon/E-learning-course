# II. Understanding data repositories and big data platforms
## 2.1 Overview of Data repositories
 
üì¶ A data repository is a system where data is collected, organized, and isolated for use in business operations, reporting, and analysis. It may range from a small to a large-scale infrastructure and can include: **Databases - Data Warehouses - Big Data Stores**

### 2.1.1 üóÉÔ∏è Databases
A database is a structured collection of data that supports: Input-Storage-Search & Retrieval-Modification
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of programs used to manage and interact with the database. ‚ûï Querying is used to extract specific information, e.g., retrieving customers inactive for 6+ months.

üß± Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
- Data organized in tables (rows & columns)
- Structured with a fixed schema
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Optimized for complex queries and large data volumes
2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
- Schema-less, flexible, scalable
- Built for handling big data, IoT, social media
- Allows storage of varied and fast-paced data
### 2.1.2 üè¢ Data Warehouse
A Data Warehouse is a centralized repository designed for analytics and business intelligence.

üîÅ ETL Process
- Extract data from multiple sources
- Transform it into a clean, usable format
- Load it into a repository
  
üîπ Related Concepts
- Data Marts: Subsets of data warehouses
- Data Lakes: Store raw and unstructured data
- Traditional data warehouses used relational databases, but modern warehouses may use NoSQL systems as well.
  
### 2.1.3 üåê Big Data Stores
Designed for very large datasets. Uses distributed computing and storage. Supports scalability and high-speed processing

‚úÖ Benefits of Data Repositories
- Centralized and isolated data
- Improved reporting and analysis
- Credible data access
- Efficient long-term storage (archiving)
---
## 2.2 RDBMS
### 2.2.1 üìå What is a Relational Database?
- A **relational database** organizes data into **tables** made of **rows (records)** and **columns (attributes)**.
- Tables can be **linked** using common fields (e.g., Customer ID).
- Enables powerful **queries** to combine data across multiple tables.

### 2.2.2 üß© Key Components
- **DBMS (Database Management System):** Software to manage, query, and maintain databases.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Standard language used for querying relational databases.

### 2.2.3 üìä Relational vs. Flat Files
| Relational DB                     | Flat File                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Multiple linked tables           | One single table per file          |
| Uses SQL for powerful queries    | Limited querying capability        |
| Scalable to millions of records  | Row/column limits (e.g., Excel)    |
| Schema enforced (structured)     | Less structured                    |

### 2.2.4 üîó Relational Structure Example
- **Customer Table**: Contains Company ID, Name, Address, Phone
- **Transaction Table**: Contains Transaction Date, Customer ID, Amount
- Tables are **related by Customer ID**

### 2.2.5 ‚úÖ Advantages of RDBMS
- **Flexibility**: Add tables/columns while running queries
- **Data Integrity**: Minimized redundancy via normalization
- **Backup & Recovery**: Easy exports/imports, cloud mirroring
- **ACID Compliance**:
  - **A**tomicity
  - **C**onsistency
  - **I**solation
  - **D**urability

### 2.2.6 ‚òÅÔ∏è Popular Relational Databases
- **On-premise**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2
- **Cloud-based (DBaaS)**:
  - Amazon RDS
  - Google Cloud SQL
  - Azure SQL Database
  - Oracle Cloud, IBM DB2 on Cloud

### 2.2.7 üîç Use Cases
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: Fast insert/update/delete for many users
- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: Business intelligence with historical data
- **IoT Solutions**: Lightweight, fast querying from edge devices

### 2.2.8 ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of RDBMS
- Not suitable for **semi-structured/unstructured data**
- **Schema-dependent** during migration between systems
- **Field length limits** may restrict large data entries
Less effective with **big data**, **social media**, or **multimedia formats**. Relational databases remain the **most widely used** solution for handling **structured data**, despite limitations in handling modern, unstructured or real-time streaming data.
---
## 2.3 NoSQL
### 2.3.1 üìå What is NoSQL?

- **NoSQL** stands for **‚ÄúNot Only SQL‚Äù**, not ‚ÄúNo SQL‚Äù.
- It refers to **non-relational databases** with **flexible schemas**, suitable for handling:Structured data- Semi-structured data- Unstructured data- Designed for scalability, performance, and handling **high-volume web/mobile/cloud applications**.

### 2.3.2 üî¢ Types of NoSQL Databases

### 1. üîë Key-Value Stores
- Data stored as **key-value pairs**
- **Use cases**: Session storage, real-time recommendations, caching
- **Examples**: Redis, Memcached, DynamoDB
- **Limitation**: Poor for querying relationships or multiple unique keys

### 2. üìÑ Document-Based Databases
- Stores entire record as a **document (e.g., JSON)**
- **Use cases**: eCommerce, medical records, CRM, analytics
- **Examples**: MongoDB, DocumentDB, CouchDB, Cloudant
- **Limitation**: Limited support for complex transactions or advanced queries

### 2.3.3 ‚öñÔ∏è NoSQL vs. RDBMS ‚Äì Key Differences

| Feature                     | RDBMS                               | NoSQL                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Schema                     | Fixed, predefined                    | Flexible, schema-less                      |
| Data Types                 | Mostly structured                    | Structured, semi-structured, unstructured  |
| Query Language             | SQL                                  | NoSQL APIs, JSON, or SQL-like languages    |
| Scaling                    | Vertical                             | Horizontal (scale-out)                     |
| ACID Compliance            | Fully supported                      | Partial or eventual consistency            |
| Cost                       | Higher (often commercial)            | Lower, supports commodity hardware         |
| Maturity                   | Long-established, well-documented    | Newer, evolving rapidly                    |

### 2.3.4 üß† Summary
- NoSQL databases were built to overcome **limitations of relational databases**, especially in the age of **cloud computing, IoT, and big data**.
- With diverse data models and horizontal scalability, NoSQL is ideal for **modern, large-scale, and agile systems**.
- While RDBMS remains dominant for structured and transactional data, **NoSQL continues to grow** in importance and adoption.

  - As a **staging area** for data warehouses

### üîÑ 2. ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)

#### üì• Extract
- **Collect raw data** from source systems
- Two methods:
  - **Batch Processing** (e.g., Stitch, Blendo)
  - **Stream Processing** (e.g., Apache Kafka, Samza, Storm)

#### üîß Transform
- Clean and standardize data:
  - Unify date formats, units
  - Remove duplicates
  - Enrich data (e.g., split full name)
  - Apply business rules
  - Validate and relate data

#### üì§ Load
- Move transformed data into destination:
  - **Initial Load**: Populate full dataset
  - **Incremental Load**: Apply periodic updates
  - **Full Refresh**: Replace data completely
- Includes **load verification** and **error recovery mechanisms**


### üîó 3. Data Pipelines

- A **broader concept** than ETL: end-to-end data movement from source to destination.
- Can handle:
  - **Batch data**
  - **Streaming data**
  - Or both (hybrid pipelines)
- Allows **real-time processing** (e.g., sensor or traffic data)
- Final destination can be:
  - **Data lake**
  - **Analytics platforms**
