# II. Understanding data repositories and big data platforms
## 2.1 Overview of Data repositories
 
üì¶ A data repository is a system where data is collected, organized, and isolated for use in business operations, reporting, and analysis. It may range from a small to a large-scale infrastructure and can include: **Databases - Data Warehouses - Big Data Stores**

### 2.1.1 üóÉÔ∏è Databases
A database is a structured collection of data that supports: Input-Storage-Search & Retrieval-Modification
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of programs used to manage and interact with the database. ‚ûï Querying is used to extract specific information, e.g., retrieving customers inactive for 6+ months.

üß± Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
- Data organized in tables (rows & columns)
- Structured with a fixed schema
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Optimized for complex queries and large data volumes
2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
- Schema-less, flexible, scalable
- Built for handling big data, IoT, social media
- Allows storage of varied and fast-paced data
### 2.1.2 üè¢ Data Warehouse
A Data Warehouse is a centralized repository designed for analytics and business intelligence.

üîÅ ETL Process
- Extract data from multiple sources
- Transform it into a clean, usable format
- Load it into a repository
  
üîπ Related Concepts
- Data Marts: Subsets of data warehouses
- Data Lakes: Store raw and unstructured data
- Traditional data warehouses used relational databases, but modern warehouses may use NoSQL systems as well.
  
### 2.1.3 üåê Big Data Stores
Designed for very large datasets. Uses distributed computing and storage. Supports scalability and high-speed processing

‚úÖ Benefits of Data Repositories
- Centralized and isolated data
- Improved reporting and analysis
- Credible data access
- Efficient long-term storage (archiving)
