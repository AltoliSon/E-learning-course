# Summary and highlight 
- In this modul, I have learned:
There are several features to modify views in Excel, and it is very straighforward toenter and edit data in a spreadsheet. 
- I can move or copy data within a worksheet or between worksheets, and you can use autofill to automatically enter data that is in a series or that fits a pattern.
- I can both format cell and data in the worksheet
- a formular is made up of several component part, and formulas can perform calculations using numbers directly or by using references to data in the worksheet.
- I can make a formula absolute by adding a dollar symbol($) to a cell reference.
- If i get errors in my formulas, I can use the error-checking capabilities of excel to resolve them.
